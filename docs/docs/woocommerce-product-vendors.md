With the release of version 2.1.0 for <a href="https://www.codemanas.com/downloads/zoom-meetings-for-woocommerce/">WooCommerce Integration with Zoom</a> plugin, It will now support <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/product-vendors/>WooCommerce product vendors</a>.

## Requirements

* <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a>
* <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/product-vendors/">WooCommerce product vendors</a> plugin
* <a href="https://www.codemanas.com/downloads/zoom-meetings-for-woocommerce/">WooCommerce Integration with Zoom</a> plugin

## How does it Work?

* Allow vendors to manually create own meetings and link them to products.
* Vendors won't see other vendors meetings.
* Vendors won't be able to select host at the time of creating a meeting as admin will assign them.

## Setup Zoom Account for Each Vendor

**Please note:** that to do this you'll need to add multiple hosts to your Zoom Account. You can do this from Users section on your <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363183-Managing-users">Zoom Account</a>.

If you have not added other users to your Zoom Account then only your name will show up.

Now goto **wp-admin > Products > Zoom Vendors** page.

From the above table. **Select your Vendor and which Zoom Account you would like to assign for that vendor.**

## What happens after Vendor with Zoom Account is Linked ?

* The Vendor meetings will always be created from the linked account.
* Vendor will be able to delete, create and edit the meetings from his side for the account that is linked and created from Zoom Meetings page.
* Vendor won't be able to see other hosts at the time of creating a new meeting or editing. 

## What happens if Vendor is not linked with Zoom Account ?

* Vendor will be able to see the list of all hosts related to the Admin Zoom Account.

**So, recommended way is to link a Zoom Account for Every Vendor everytime.**
