Zoom Meeting linked with Product ( Zoom Product ) This method should be used to link Zoom Meeting with a Product. The product created using this method will not be shown on shop and search pages. The meeting created using this method is designed to be directly purchased via the zoom meeting single page. See image below. How to create a Zoom Meeting Go to WordPress admin menu \"Zoom Meetings\" Add a New Zoom Meeting - fill out all the details like you would for the Zoom Meeting. After filling everything out there is a sidebar area that says WooCommerce Integration. Check the box that says enable purchase and enter the price that't it - the Zoom Product will then be purchasable via the Zoom Meeting Page. Please see video below. Shortcode [vczapi_wc_show_purchasable_meetings per_page=\"10\" type=\"table\" order=\"DESC\" upcoming_only=\"no\"] Usage: This allows you to show your purchasable meeting lists. Show in DESC or ASC format as well as show upcoming only or not.

You can either choose to send emails 24 hours before the meeting or 3 hours before. Meeting Reminder Worklow: Meeting reminder email uses your WordPress configuration to send e-mails. Please make sure the mail sent out by your site is not going into spam. Meeting reminder are dependent on cron job - the cron event name is \"vczapi_meeting_events_cron\" and it is run hourly. So please make sure cron jobs are running properly on your system. It is recommended that you switch to a true cron job https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/real-cron-job/ to make sure your e-mails are being sent properly. User will not be sent an e-mail if they have purchased the meeting after the initial notification time has passed. So example if meeting time is less than 24 hours away - and new user has purchased the meeting the will not get 24 hour neeting alert. They will only get (if configured) - 3 hours away reminder email.
